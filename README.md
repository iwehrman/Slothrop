Slothrop is an automated equational theorem prover that performs a variant of [Knuth-Bendix completion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth-Bendix_completion_algorithm). Instead of requiring an a priori term ordering to ensure convergence of rewriting, the space of orderings is searched. A [termination checker](http://www-i2.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/AProVE/) is used to restrict search to the well-orderings. Input is given in TPTP format. A [detailed description](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~iwehrman/pub/rta06.pdf) is available. 

Based on an implementation of completion by Franz Baader and Tobias Nipkow, copyright 1998 Cambridge University Press, and on supporting data structures copyright 2003 Jean-Christophe Filliatre.
